# Velocidad-AI

**An antifragile Spanish fluency engine powered by agent mode.**

Speak first. Fail. Log what broke. Drill the friction. Speak again.

---

## Core Hypothesis

Speed to conversational Spanish comes from **production pressure**, not comprehension study.

> Fluency = Retrieval under pressure + Pattern recognition + Motor memory

## How It Works

### The 5-Part Daily Engine (25-30 min)

1. **Speak First** (5-7 min) — Roleplay scenario, Spanish only, no prep
2. **Extract Friction** (3 min) — Log what you couldn't say, hesitated on, didn't understand
3. **Targeted Micro-Drills** (7-10 min) — 10 production + 5 repair + 5 variation reps
4. **Shadowing** (5 min) — Native audio: listen once, shadow 3x
5. **Micro-Deploy** (optional) — One real interaction, even 20 seconds

### The Flywheel

```
Deploy → Capture → Distill → Rehearse → Redeploy
```

Bedrock is a byproduct of interaction, not a prerequisite.

### Depth-First Progression

- **Week 1:** Coffee World (order, clarify, small talk, pay)
- **Week 2:** Grocery World (find items, ask help, checkout)
- **Week 3:** Small Talk World (weather, plans, compliments)

Each week goes deep on one scenario. Patterns compound across contexts.

## Agent Services

| Service | Prompt | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Master** | `prompts/master.md` | All-in-one daily engine (session + distill + drill + plan) |
| **Session Runner** | `prompts/session-runner.md` | Roleplay-only mode with NPC characters |
| **Distiller** | `prompts/distiller.md` | Extract friction, chunks, patterns from transcripts |
| **SRS Generator** | `prompts/srs-generator.md` | Create spaced repetition cards from failures |
| **Session Planner** | `prompts/session-planner.md` | Plan tomorrow's session + micro-deploy mission |
| **Meta-Observer** | `prompts/meta-observer.md` | Weekly system review — how the learner learns, what to adjust |

What we **don't** build: dashboards, gamification, progress trees, curriculum planners.

## The Living Library

The `language-reference/` directory is a self-contained Spanish learning compendium — useful to agent mode learners running sessions AND to anyone browsing the repo who wants a solid reference.

**Four sections, one library:**

| Section | Files | What you get |
|---------|-------|--------------|
| **System** | 00-05 | How Spanish works: sounds, gender, pronouns, verbs, sentence structure |
| **Reference** | 06-10 | Look things up: 1,000 words, cognate rules, verb tables, numbers, prepositions |
| **Methods** | 11-14 | How to learn: 18 acquisition methods, 200 cloze exercises, 165+ keyword mnemonics, AI reverse engineering |
| **Field Guides** | FIELD-MANUAL + others | Deploy in the real world: tactical reference, German bridges, priority order |

**Highlights:**
- **[Core Vocabulary](language-reference/06-core-vocabulary.md)** — 1,000 words in 4 frequency bands with example sentences
- **[Cognate Accelerator](language-reference/07-cognate-accelerator.md)** — 18 suffix rules that unlock 3,000+ words from English
- **[Rapid Acquisition Methods](language-reference/11-rapid-acquisition-methods.md)** — Every proven technique from Output Hypothesis to Memory Palace
- **[Cloze Exercises](language-reference/12-cloze-method.md)** — 200 fill-in-the-blank exercises across 6 skill tiers
- **[Mnemonic Dictionary](language-reference/13-mnemonic-dictionary.md)** — Vivid keyword images for words that won't stick
- **[AI Reverse Engineering Handbook](language-reference/14-ai-reverse-engineering-handbook.md)** — The meta of the meta: 7-layer stack, interference maps, error archaeology, compression theory, 7 novel AI techniques

> **Your personal sessions, SRS state, mastery tracking, and profile live in a separate
> private directory — see [Architecture](#architecture) below.**

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy the paths config template
cp config/paths.yaml.template config/paths.yaml

# 2. Edit config/paths.yaml — point learner_data_dir at your private data directory
#    Example: ../[your-private-repo]/velocidad
#    See docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md for what that directory needs to contain.

# 3. Open VS Code with agent mode (or any Claude/GPT interface)
# 4. Paste the contents of prompts/master.md into the agent
# 5. Tell it which world to run (e.g., "Today's world: mcdonalds")
# 6. Do the session. The agent handles everything else.
```

**First time?** `docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md` has the initialization checklist — seven files to create, takes about ten minutes.

## Architecture

Velocidad-AI separates two concerns that most learning tools merge together:

**Engine (this repo — public)**  
The methodology, prompts, scenario ladders, and universal reference material. Stateless — contains no knowledge about you. Can be forked, improved, shared.

**Learner data (your private repo)**  
Your profile, your sessions, your SRS card state, your mastery tracking, your observations about how you learn. Grows with every session. Stays private. Implements the contract in `docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md`.

The coupling between them is intentional and minimal: `config/paths.yaml` (gitignored) tells the engine where your data lives. The prompts reference `{learner_data_dir}/profile.yaml` — a documented path you configure once.

```
velocidad-ai/          ← engine (public)
  config/paths.yaml    ← gitignored, points at your data dir
  docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md  ← the contract
  prompts/             ← reads from {learner_data_dir}

[your-private-repo]/velocidad/  ← learner data (private, your repo)
  profile.yaml
  sessions/
  srs/
  progress/
  meta/learning-observations.md
```

See the [Learner Data Spec](docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md) for the full directory tree and file schemas.

### Releasing the Engine Publicly

If your private repo has session history and you want to share the engine without exposing that history:

```bash
# Set PUBLIC_REPO_URL in publish-public.sh, then:
./publish-public.sh
```

This creates an orphan clone — a fresh git repository with a single flat commit containing only engine files. Your private history stays local. The public repo shows no history of personal data. Run it again anytime to update the public release.

## Design Principles

- **Retrieval dominance** — Speak before seeing answers
- **Contextual repetition** — Same scenario, different angles
- **Emotional salience** — Real scenarios you'll actually use
- **Minimal cognitive overload** — 25-30 min, one scenario per week
- **Pattern compounding** — Week 1 patterns return in Week 2
- **Motor repetition** — Say it out loud; mouth muscle matters

## Documentation

- [Language Reference Library](language-reference/README.md) — Complete index of all reference material with reading orders
- [Learner Data Spec](docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md) — The contract between engine and personal data directory
- [Design Document](docs/design.md) — Vision, architecture, ideas, implementation plan
- [Seed Conversation](docs/seed/chatgpt-seed-conversation.md) — Original brainstorm that spawned this project

## Fork This For Yourself

The methodology is universal. The data is yours.

**Step 1: Create your learner data directory**  
Anywhere in a private repo. Run through the initialization checklist in `docs/LEARNER-DATA-SPEC.md` — creates the directory tree, profile file, blank SRS boxes, and progress tracking files.

**Step 2: Configure the path**
```bash
cp config/paths.yaml.template config/paths.yaml
# Edit config/paths.yaml — set learner_data_dir to your directory path
```

**Step 3: Customize three things in your learner data directory:**

1. **`profile.yaml`** — Your motivation, real deployment targets (the actual people you'll practice with), and learning tendencies. Be specific. This is what the agent reads to personalize every session.

2. **`worlds/`** (in your data dir, or fork from engine) — The included worlds reflect one person's life. Swap in yours. Each world is a markdown file with a 5-level scenario ladder.

3. **`meta/language-architecture.md`** — The engine version is built for Spanish. If you're learning something else, copy it to your data directory and rewrite the 6 layers for that system.

**What you don't need to touch to get started:** prompts, session template, chunk/pattern reference files. All universal.
